Videre utvikling
----------------
Inntil jeg finner ut av Rails, fortsett å utvikle kjernekoden slik at jeg kan finne ut hva jeg bruker penger på hver måned, og hvor mye (se statistikk-usecase i Excel-fil), pga det er dette jeg trenger mest ATM (for å kunne budsjettere tiden i Oslo, hvor dyr leilighet jeg kan ha.)

Mao: PRIORITET: CSV-BASERT UTGIFTSSTATISTIKK, med fordeling på kategorier og tidsrom (mnd i første omgang). Output kan være enten CSV-data for excel, eller en HTML5-RGraph

Gamle notater
-------------

1. As a user, I can see a diagram that shows the predicted/budgeted balance for a given date range (usually month, quarter or year, but date-specific ranges should be possible, with any chosen interval).
	1.1. Calculate a continous balance based on several transactions. The balance updates after each transaction.
		OK 1.1.1 We'll need an account, which can contain transactions.
		1.1.1.1 The account must be able to give a balance at a given point of time.
		OK 1.1.1.2 ... Or perhaps just a list of the changing balance values?
		OK 1.1.1.3. In any case, a balance is connected to one transaction. Iow, in two columns showing transaction sum and balance, each sum updates the balance.
		OK 1.1.1.4 And how do we get all the data needed by the diagram/scatter? Use TDD.
	1.2. I want to be able to adjust whether I want to see the changes as gradually changing (F=yx+b) or stepwise changing (a "stair"-graph)
	... (fill out)
OK 2. As a user, I can see a diagram that shows predicted vs actual balance, today's date, and the adjusted predicted balance (which is recalculated prediction based on actual spendings until the current time.)
	- Dependency: 1.
3. As a user, I want to import transactions from my web bank (so that I can do other stuff with these transactions, for instance view the accout balance)
	3.1 Copy+paste directly from web bank account transaction page
	3.2 Import from CSV
	
	
NY:
OK * Lage transaksjoner med debet og kredit
OK * Få gammel funksjonalitet inn i nytt transaksjonssystem
OK * Test that credit=debit
* What about splitted transactions?
* Importere transaksjoner fra CSV




	def set_post_balance(new_post)
		if @posts.length == 1
			# The new post is the only post, thus its balance must be 0.
			new_post.balance = 0
			return
		end
		
		(0..@posts.length).each do |i|
			if @posts[i].equals?(new_post)
				last_post = @posts[i - 1]
				if new_post.transaction.debit_account.equals?(self)
					new_post.balance = last_post.balance + new_post.transaction.amount
				elsif new_post.transaction.credit_account.equals?(self)
					new_post.balance = last_post.balance - new_post.transaction.amount
				end
				
				break
			end
			
		end
		
	end
